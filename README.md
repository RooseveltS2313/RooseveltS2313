- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roosevelt Seymour Jr. @RooseveltS2313
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in meeting a team of programmers or someone who can help get me started in the industry
      or give me the experience I need to stand on my own two feet 
- âœ¨ Code that is stored in the repositiory are things that I have done during my time at University or after graduation
      that I think conveys both the techniques I was taught and my inexperience that I hope to learn and improve on.
- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is by 
      EMAIL :
